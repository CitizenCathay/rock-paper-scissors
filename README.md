# rock-paper-scissors
A simple rock paper scissors game

#### Stage 1
Made game in browser console, played only 5 rounds using a for loop.
Used string comparison to determine round winner.

#### Stage 2
Design and implement UI (buttons, sound effects, replay button) & refactor game code to accomodate UI.
Use object properties instead of string comparison to determine winner (allowed me to reduce the game logic by several lines).

### **What I learnt**
- Enhanced knowledge of CSS through better understanding of shared properties, transitions and styles.
- Practiced basic DOM manipulations in JavaScript (appendChild, getElementById & others).
- Use of objects and key-value pairs to improve readability of codes.
- Improved documentation of code to enhance readability.
